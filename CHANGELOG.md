# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — scaffold + enrollment/sign-in
- New native Kotlin / Jetpack Compose project (Material 3, single-activity).
- Configurable server base URL (no host baked into the repo); `/meta` handshake
  on connect.
- Enrollment by one-time code: `/auth/enroll` -> device token -> `/me`.
- Device token stored encrypted via an AES-256-GCM key in the Android Keystore.
- Session-driven auth gate: Setup -> Enroll -> Home, with sign-out (`/auth/revoke`).
- Networking: Retrofit + OkHttp + kotlinx.serialization, one uniform error path.
- Home screen is a placeholder showing the enrolled person; dashboard next.
