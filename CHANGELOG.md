# Changelog

## 0.3.0 — workouts (day-level)
- Workout prompts on Home now open an action sheet: Mark as done, Rest day, or
  undo. Backed by `POST /api/v1/workouts/complete` / `/uncomplete` / `/rest`.
- Set-by-set logging (exercises, weights, reps) is the next workout increment.

## 0.2.0 — home dashboard + tap-to-complete
- Home now shows the personal day from `GET /api/v1/dashboard`: an overall
  completion percent, per-category progress bars, an overdue section, and the
  day grouped by category (chores, reading, exercise, school, …).
- Tap a task to complete/uncomplete it (`POST /api/v1/tasks/{id}/complete` /
  `/uncomplete`); bars and percent refresh from the server so derived values
  stay authoritative.
- Pull to refresh; loading, error (with retry), and empty-day states.
- Workout prompts are shown but not yet tappable (they need the workout logger,
  a later increment).

## 0.1.0 — scaffold + enrollment/sign-in
- New native Kotlin / Jetpack Compose project (Material 3, single-activity).
- Configurable server base URL (no host baked into the repo); `/meta` handshake.
- Enrollment by one-time code: `/auth/enroll` -> device token -> `/me`.
- Device token stored encrypted via an AES-256-GCM key in the Android Keystore.
- Session-driven auth gate: Setup -> Enroll -> Home, with sign-out (`/auth/revoke`).
